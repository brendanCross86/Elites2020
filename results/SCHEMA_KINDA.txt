So we need a tweet file (id, timestamp, uid), 
retweet file (tweet id, retweet id, retweet uid), 
quote file (tweet id, quote id, quote uid), 
replied file (tweet id, replied id, replied uid), 
mentioned file (tweet id, mentioned uid), 
hashtag file (tweet id, hashtag), 
user file (uid, creation of uid), 
classification file (tweet id, stance).
